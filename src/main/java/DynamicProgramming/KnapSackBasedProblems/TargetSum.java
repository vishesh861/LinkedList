public class TargetSum {

  /*  eg : int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5}  and sum = 1

            Ques : In this we have to find in how many ways we will get the target sum if we assign +/- sign in front of
            array elements???

            Sol : This problem is exactly same as CountSubsetWithGivenDiff.*/
